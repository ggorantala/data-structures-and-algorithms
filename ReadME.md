## Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of computer science and software development. Understanding these concepts allows developers to write efficient, optimized, and scalable code. This repository covers various data structures and algorithms, providing clear explanations and code samples for each.

## Data Structures
### Arrays
- **Definition**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for quick lookups and iteration.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal, searching.
- **Examples**: One-dimensional array, two-dimensional arrays.
Linked Lists
Definition: A linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next node.
Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
Use Cases: Dynamic memory allocation, implemented in situations where frequent insertions and deletions occur.
Stacks
Definition: A collection that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Use Cases: Function calls, undo operations in editors, parentheses checking.
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
Queues
Definition: A collection that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Use Cases: Scheduling processes, managing requests in systems.
Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.
Trees
Definition: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Trees.
Use Cases: Organizing hierarchical data, efficient searching, and sorting.
Graphs
Definition: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.
Use Cases: Social networks, navigation systems, dependency resolution.
Heaps
Definition: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
Types: Max-Heap, Min-Heap.
Use Cases: Priority queues, sorting algorithms (Heap Sort).
Hash Tables
Definition: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
Use Cases: Fast lookups, database indexing.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, search, collision resolution.
